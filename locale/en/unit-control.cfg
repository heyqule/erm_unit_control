erm-unit-control-selection-limit=The maximum number of units that can be selected at one time.\n\nHigh value may have performance penalty.
erm-unit-control-selection-radius=The radius to scan for friendly units under certain selections, e.g selecting same type of unit.\n\nHigh value may have performance penalty.
erm-unit-control-hunting-mode=Hunting strategy allows the selected group to attack nearby enemy military entities. It's experimental feature and may not be optimized.  This function is not compatible with PVP as find_nearby_enemies() knows your enemy's exact spots.
erm-unit-control-reactive-defense-mode=Reactive defense strategy sends nearby units to attack move to the location of destroyed friendly entity.  Once they have completed the mission, they return to original location.  Some of them may desert occasionally
erm-unit-control-reactive-defense-unit-search-range=The maximum distance to search between units location and destroyed entity location.\n\nHigh value may have performance penalty.

erm-unit-control-perimeter-mode=When a radar complete a scan and see enemy military entities, the units near the radar will try eliminate enemy at that location.

[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
ermuc-unit-control=It's based off Klonan's unit control.  We have added a few additional features.\n\n- You can have up to 9 Control groups. You can use hotkeys to create & select groups.\n- Max unit selection is capped at 100 unit by default. (Configurable in map setting)\n- [font=default-semibold]Hunting Mode:[/font] Search and destroy operation\n -[font=default-semibold]Quick React:[/font] When there are units are near a same-force entity that has been killed. They perform an attack move to that location, and then return to original position afterward.\n-[font=default-semibold]Perimeter mode:[/font] When radar scan a sector and found an enemy entity, the group near the radar will attack move to that location and return afterward. 
ermuc-control-listing=[font=default-semibold]Attack Move:[/font]  Select unit > right click on destination. (orange dotted line indicator)\n[font=default-semibold]Go to destination(non-attack move):[/font]  Select unit > double right click on destination. (green dotted line indicator)\n[font=default-semibold]Multiple Waypoints:[/font] Select unit > hold shift and right click on destinations.\n[font=default-semibold]Patrol:[/font] Select units > click add patrol waypoint button > right click destination. (shift and right click for multiple destinations).\n[font=default-semibold]Scout:[/font] select unit, click scout button and they will move to all directions\n[font=default-semibold]Select all unit in X tiles radius:[/font] Shift+Alt+left click\n\nWarning: When the unit stopped/idled for a very long time, they may not response to enemy attacks if the player is not near by.  My guess is due to the unit performance optimization.  You should always put idle unit on patrol.
