[mod-setting-description]
erm-unit-control-selection-limit=The maximum number of units that can be selected at one time.\n\nHigher value may have performance penalty.
erm-unit-control-selection-radius=The radius to scan for friendly units under certain selections, e.g selecting same type of unit.\n\nHigher value may have performance penalty.
erm-unit-control-follow-command-wait=How long should an unit wait before repeat the FOLLOW command. Lower value have better response time and may have performance penalty.
erm-unit-control-patrol-command-wait=How long should an unit wait before repeat the PATROL command. Longer wait time allows repair bot have longer repair time.
erm-unit-control-enable-suicide-gui=Enable "suicide" and "suicide all" button on GUI.  You can disable it to prevent accidental clicks.  You'll rely on hotkey to do so.
erm-unit-control-hunting-mode=Hunting strategy allows the selected group to perform search and destroy at nearby enemy military entities. It's experimental feature and may not be optimized.  This function is not compatible with PVP as find_nearby_enemies() knows your enemy's exact spots.
erm-unit-control-reactive-defense-mode=Reactive defense strategy sends nearby units to attack move to the location of destroyed friendly entity.  Once they have completed the mission, they return to original location.\n\nSometimes its group pathing may disrupted by enemy fire/acid patch attacks. Use at your own risk.
erm-unit-control-reactive-defense-unit-search-range=The maximum distance to search between units location and destroyed entity location.\n\nHigher value may have performance penalty.
erm-unit-control-reactive-defense-cooldown=Action cooldown after a search have performed.\n\nLower value may have performance penalty.
erm-unit-control-perimeter-mode=When a radar complete a scan and see enemy military entities, the units near the radar will try eliminate enemy at that location. Once they have completed the mission, they return to original location.\n\nUsing rapid scan radar mod with this strategy may have performance penalty.
erm-unit-control-enable-runtime-optimization=Enable Runtime Optimization.  It enabled some caching mechanism to reduce runtime executions. Unit path indicators and following control group viewport may be inaccurate under this mode.

ermuc-unit-control=It's based off Klonan's unit control.  We have added a few additional features.\n\n- You can have up to 9 Control groups. You can use hotkeys to create & select groups.\n- Max unit selection is capped at 100 unit by default. (Configurable in map setting)\n- [font=default-semibold]Hunting Mode:[/font] Search and destroy operation\n-[font=default-semibold]Quick React:[/font] When there are units are near a same-force entity that has been killed. They perform an attack move to that location, and then return to original position afterward.\n-[font=default-semibold]Perimeter mode:[/font] When radar scan a sector and found an enemy entity, the group near the radar will attack move to that location and return afterward. 
ermuc-control-listing=[font=default-semibold]Select all unit in X tiles radius:[/font] __CONTROL__select-all-units__ on an unit.\n[font=default-semibold]Select all unit of same type in X radius:[/font] Double __CONTROL__left-click__ on a unit.\n[font=default-semibold]Attack Move:[/font]  Select unit > right click on destination. (orange dotted line indicator)\n[font=default-semibold]Attack Target[/font] Shift - right click on an enemy target.\n[font=default-semibold]Go to destination (non-attack move):[/font]  Select unit > double right click on destination. (green dotted line indicator)\n[font=default-semibold]Multiple Waypoints:[/font] Select unit > hold shift and right click on destinations.\n[font=default-semibold]Control Groups:[/font] __CONTROL__erm-unit-control-set_control_group_1__ to create group, __CONTROL__erm-unit-control-select_control_group_1__ to select group.\n[font=default-semibold]Patrol:[/font] Select units, click add patrol waypoint button, right click destination. (shift and right click for multiple destinations).\n[font=default-semibold]Scout:[/font] Select unit, click scout button and they will move to all directions\n[font=default-semibold]Follow:[/font] Select unit, click follow target button, click on any friendly entity with health and they will follow.  Alt: Shift + right-click on the follow target.\n[font=default-semibold]Reactive defense:[/font]Move units to an active warzone. When an entity dies nearby, they'll march to that location, then return to original location after mission completed. (Default: Off)\n[font=default-semibold]Hunting Mode:[/font] Select unit, click hunting mode button, they will search nearby enemy entity to kill.  (Default: Off)\n\n[font=default-semibold]Suicide and Suicide All:[/font] Select unit, use GUI buttons or press __CONTROL__suicide__ or __CONTROL__suicide-all__ to kill them.\n\nWarning: When the unit stopped/idled for a very long time, they may not response to enemy attacks if the player is not near by.  My guess is due to the unit performance optimization.  You should always put idle unit on patrol.  If you have reactive defense turned on, you can place them behind some defense buildings.
